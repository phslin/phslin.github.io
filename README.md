## Website Plan: Company Site for Mobile App Development

### Overview
This project is a static, client-side-only website for a company specializing in mobile app development. The site will showcase the company's expertise, portfolio, services, and contact information. No server-side logic will be involved; all content will be delivered as static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
